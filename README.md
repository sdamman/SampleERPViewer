# SampleERPViewer
## Sample WPF Application created as a view-only client for ERP data.

### SEV can do the following:
- Look up Item Master information.
- Search by part description, part number, or vendor part number
- Perform advanced description search using multiple contains, starts with, or ends with terms
- Look up BOMs
- Look up Where-Used information
- Look up Job Orders
- Look up Sales Orders
- All returned information can be copied to the clipboard with a single click and then pasted into other applications, typically Excel, in the same tabular format it was displayed in SEV.
